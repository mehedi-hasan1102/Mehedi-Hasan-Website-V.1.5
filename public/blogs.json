Security is critical; developers must ensure PCI compliance, encrypt sensitive data, and protect against fraud. Popular gateways include Stripe, PayPal, and Razorpay, which provide APIs and SDKs for seamless integration. Understanding the end-to-end flow, from front-end form submission to back-end verification, ensures smooth transactions for users and minimizes errors or chargebacks for businesses.

    "description": "How British teenager Bo Jesap created 'Special Names,' helping over 2 million children get meaningful English names, earning over £48,000 in the process.",
    "fullContent": "Bo Jesap, a British teenager, visited China and helped a couple choose an English name for their child. This simple act sparked the idea of creating a platform to assist Chinese parents in choosing meaningful, culturally appropriate, and internationally accepted English names for their children. The result is Special Names, a website that suggests names based on personality traits. Users pay 80 pence per selection, and names can be shared on WeChat. To date, the platform has helped name over 2 million children, earning Bo Jesap more than £48,000 (over half a million Bangladeshi Taka). The main lesson: wherever there’s a problem, there’s an opportunity. Innovation isn’t just technology—it’s a creative solution to a need. Even a small idea can achieve international success if applied correctly, proving that for entrepreneurs, thought is the real capital, not age, tradition, or funding.",
